# Reports

The **Reports** tile is a launcher for different ways of looking at your data. The reports are grouped by purpose so the right one is easy to find: **Development & performance** (ratings, progress, rate cards), **Playing time** (minutes played and squad load), **Attendance** (team and player attendance statistics and the leaderboard), **Recruitment** (scouting, prospects, trial funnel), **Staff & quality** (coach activity and evaluation quality), and **Season overview** (the annual review). Sections you don't have access to — recruitment and season-wide reports are academy-admin only — simply don't appear. All standard reports — including team attendance, player attendance, the leaderboard and minutes-per-team — live here and breadcrumb under **Reports**; they are no longer duplicated on the Analytics dashboard.

If **every** report is unavailable to you — all of them switched off for your academy, or none within your access — the launcher says so plainly instead of showing a blank grid, and points you to ask an administrator to enable a report or widen your scope.

## Player progress

Quick visual reports for coaches:

- **Player progress** — radar charts of your top players.
- **Player comparison** — pick two or more players and see their latest evaluations as overlapping radars.
- **Team averages** — per-team averages across the main categories.

For deeper per-player views, see [Rate cards](?page=tt-docs&topic=rate-cards) and [Player comparison](?page=tt-docs&topic=player-comparison).

## Team rating averages

A simple table — one row per team, one column per main category, plus an evaluation count. Shows the lifetime average across active evaluations on each team. Archived players and archived evaluations are left out.

A quick way to see which team is strongest this season.

## Coach activity

How many evaluations each coach has saved in the chosen window (last 7, 30, 90, 180 or 365 days). Useful for spotting a coach who has fallen behind, or for confirming that a planned assessment period actually happened.

Only coaches within your own club are counted — the report is scoped to the current tenant and never surfaces activity from another academy. A coach whose user account has been deleted still appears (their saved evaluations remain in the window) but is labelled **Unknown coach** rather than a raw account number.

## Coach · Evaluation quality (v4.20.123)

The head-of-development's evaluation spot-check as a report: one row per coach with their evaluation count, rating count, mean rating, standard deviation, the most-given rating (and what share of all their ratings sits at it), and the date of their last evaluation. Filterable by team and date range.

Rows where the standard deviation is below **0.5** across **10 or more ratings** are flagged *low variance* — the statistical signature of a coach rating everyone the same number. A coach with only a handful of ratings is never flagged; there's no meaningful variance to measure yet.

Restricted to academy-wide roles (head of development / admin): coaches cannot see each other's statistics. The **Export (CSV)** button downloads the same rows; integrations can read them from `GET /wp-json/talenttrack/v1/reports/coach-evaluation-quality` with the same permission gate.

## Frontend reports + Print/Save as PDF (v3.79.0)

Team rating averages and Coach activity now render natively on the public dashboard at `?tt_view=reports&type=team_ratings` and `?type=coach_activity` — no more wp-admin tab jump. Each report has a **Print / Save as PDF** button at the top: clicking it opens the browser's print dialog with a stylesheet that strips dashboard chrome, so picking "Save as PDF" produces a clean tabular PDF.

## Player · Progress & radar (v4.20.124)

The legacy wp-admin "Player Progress & Radar" report now renders natively on the dashboard as a standard report (Reports → *Player · Progress & radar*). Same three modes with the same data: **Player Progress** (each selected player's last five evaluations as stacked radar series — leave the selection empty for the top-10 active players), **Player Comparison** (each player's most recent evaluation overlaid on one radar; pick at least two), and **Team Averages** (one radar series per team, averaged per category).

Coaches see only their own teams' players and teams; academy-wide roles see everything. The old wp-admin route redirects here, so bookmarks keep working. Integrations can read the same datasets from `GET /wp-json/talenttrack/v1/reports/player-radar?mode=…&player_ids=…`.

## Only past, actually-held activities count

Both attendance reports — and the leaderboard and at-risk panel that share their query — only count activities that have **actually been held**: completed, in the past (session date today or earlier). An activity dated in the future never contributes to an attendance statistic, even if attendance was pre-filled on it. An activity dated **today** does count. This keeps each player's attendance figure truthful — a coach reviewing a profile sees only sessions the player could really have attended.

## Filtering the attendance reports — period pills + activity type

Both the team report and the player report carry the same filtering vocabulary as the activities list:

- **Period quick-pills** — *Last week*, *This month* (month-to-date), *This season*. These are retrospective (the reports look back). Picking a pill sets the From/To window for you. The explicit **From / To** date range is always the manual override — type a date there and it wins over the pill.
- **Activity type** — narrow to one type (training / game / tournament, whatever your academy has configured). The type filter narrows every figure consistently: the KPI tiles, the table, the leaderboard and the at-risk panel.

**Default window.** When you open a report without picking a pill or typing a From/To range, it defaults to **the current season** — from the season's start date through today. This matches the *This season* pill and how the academy thinks about the year, rather than an arbitrary rolling window. If no season is configured, the report falls back to the last **90 days** so it always shows something. The team-minutes report follows the same default. Picking a pill or typing a manual From/To still overrides it. Because this default *is* the season window, both attendance reports now show the ***This season* pill highlighted** on first open — the filter bar reflects the window you're actually looking at, instead of reading "Custom range".

**Scope note.** When you only coach some teams, the attendance reports show just those teams. If your filters return nothing, the empty-state message says the report is **limited to the teams you coach**, so an empty window doesn't read as "the academy has no data".

On a phone the filters collapse into a **Filters** button that opens a bottom sheet; from desktop width up they sit inline. Every control is keyboard-operable.

## Drilling into a team's players (team report)

On the team report each team row is **tap-to-expand**: tapping the team name opens an inline sub-table of that team's players (player · present %, with at-risk players marked), loaded on demand for the active window and filters. Tapping again collapses it; one team is open at a time. Without JavaScript, a **View players** link beside each team opens the player report pre-filtered to that team instead — the drill-down is always reachable.

## Minutes played — totals and per-match trace

The minutes reports read only **recorded** match minutes: actual, non-guest
attendance. Planned (expected) roster rows and guest appearances never count,
and a match with no recorded minutes contributes nothing — the reports never
estimate, calculate, or construct minutes, so a zero is an honest "no data
recorded" rather than a guess. Minutes are worked out once, when a played
match is recorded (the match execution is finalised, or minutes are entered by
hand on the attendance screen), and stored on the attendance row. Every report
simply reads that stored value; a match that was played but never finalised
therefore shows nothing until its minutes are recorded, rather than being
reconstructed from the planned line-up.

**Matches, games and tournaments all count.** The minutes reports treat
matches, games and tournaments the same way — each is a minutes-bearing
activity. A single-game tournament records minutes exactly like a match (plan a
line-up, run the live match surface, finalise); a multi-game-day tournament
records minutes with the by-hand per-player entry on the attendance screen (how
many minutes each player actually played across the day). Either way the minutes
land on the attendance row and every report reads them. A tournament with no
recorded minutes still shows nothing — the same honest zero as a match.

**Starts (basisplaatsen) count only recorded matches.** A player's *starts* and
the *% available* figure count only matches that were actually recorded (that
produced stored minutes) — a match that was planned, with a line-up, but never
played or recorded contributes nothing to either. Starts can therefore never
exceed matches. For a multi-game-day tournament the line-up-derived "starts" are
approximate (one line-up covers several games), so the recorded *minutes* are
the meaningful figure there, not the start count.

Every player's minutes total is a **drill-down**: open it to see the per-match
rows that sum to it — date, match, type, source (`actual` recorded minutes) and
minutes. The breakdown reconciles
exactly with the total, so you can always trace a reported number back to its
source rows. On the Team · Minutes distribution report each player bar expands;
on the Analytics minutes report each Total opens the per-match table beneath the
row. Both work on a phone and by keyboard; without JavaScript the per-match rows
stay visible inline.

Integrations can read the same trace — gated on `tt_view_reports` with the same
team-scope narrowing as the report:

- `GET /wp-json/talenttrack/v1/teams/{team_id}/players/{player_id}/minutes?from=…&to=…` — the per-match minutes rows for one player and the reconciling `total_minutes`.

To verify a total against the raw stored rows, the `tt_attendance` minutes rows
(`minutes_played`, `record_type`, `is_guest`, `activity_id`) are browsable in
the **Data Browser**.

The per-match breakdown table is now a **single shared component** across the
Team · Minutes distribution report and the Analytics minutes-played report, so
the two never drift and both reconcile to the player's total the same way.

## Minutes audit — games × players auditability matrix

The **Minutes audit** report (reachable from the Reports launcher under *Playing
time*, or directly at `?tt_view=minutes-audit`) is the auditability companion to
the minutes report. It answers a different question: *for each game, which squad
players have recorded minutes and which do not?* — so an admin or head coach can
spot and chase the gaps before a season's minutes data goes stale.

It is **read-only**. Each row's *Edit* / *Record* link opens the game's activity
detail, where minutes are actually recorded; the in-place editable grid is a
separate, later feature.

The surface is a spreadsheet-style matrix:

- **Rows** are the team's game, match and tournament activities in the window
  (the same set the minutes report counts).
- **Columns** are the squad — every player who appears on the **attendance** of
  those games. The squad is resolved from attendance, not from a player's team
  assignment, so a player who was borrowed for one game still shows up, and a
  player who left the team but played earlier in the window is not silently
  dropped.
- **Cells** show the minutes recorded for that player in that game. A green cell
  is minutes recorded; a red **0** is a player who was in the squad but has no
  minutes recorded (a gap to chase); a hatched dash is a player who was not in
  that game's squad.
- Each row carries a **row total**, a completeness **status chip** — *Complete*
  (every squad player has minutes), *Incomplete* (some do, some don't), or *Not
  recorded* (nothing recorded for the game) — and the bottom **column-total** row
  sums each player's minutes across the visible games.

Above the matrix, four **gap KPIs** — *Games*, *Fully recorded*, *Incomplete*,
*Not recorded* — summarise the window. Each KPI is clickable and filters the
matrix to that completeness bucket, so *Not recorded* jumps straight to the games
still missing minutes.

Because the audit reads the **same** recorded, actual, non-guest minutes as the
minutes report, its numbers reconcile with that report exactly. The honest-zero
rules apply here too: a team with games but no recorded minutes shows every game,
honest *Not recorded* chips, and a clear next-action note — never a misleading
"0 players" empty state. An empty window (no games at all) says so distinctly.

Coaches see only the teams they coach; academy-wide roles see the whole club. The
filter bar carries the shared team / period / match-type / date-range controls
and defaults to the current-season window.

## Standard reports — honest numbers

Every standard report now names the window and the source it drew from, so a
figure is never a silent guess:

- **Honest empty states.** When a report has nothing to show it says *why* in
  plain terms — "No matches recorded in this period", "No evaluations recorded
  for this team in this window", "No prospects logged in this window" — instead
  of the old generic "adjust a filter" copy (most of these reports have no
  filter to adjust). The Season summary no longer renders a blank page below
  its headline tiles when no teams exist.
- **Player · Minutes played** covers the **last 12 months** (stated in the
  page sub-line, matching the Explorer drill), and when a player has more than
  50 matches in that window it says *"Showing the 50 most recent matches"* so a
  longer history is never dropped without notice.
- **Team · Squad evaluation summary** shows a **Last evaluated** date per
  player, so a stale row is visible at a glance.
- **Season summary** per-team match counts ignore soft-archived activities on
  the join itself (not just in the count), removing a source of inflated joins.

### Trial funnel reconciliation

The Season · Trial funnel now **reconciles**. The Per-decision table lists the
outcomes of cases *opened in the window*, plus a **Pending (not yet decided)**
row and a **Total** row that sums to *Trial cases opened*. The **Decision rate**
tile carries a one-line note that its numerator (cases decided, by decision
date) and denominator (cases opened, by open date) use different windows, so
the percentage isn't misread as a same-cohort rate. Each scout name in the Per
scout table links to that scout's **Scout report card** (gated on
`tt_view_reports`, the same capability the card enforces).

### Minutes-played (team) — shared filter + KPI chrome

The Minutes-played (team) report now uses the **shared filter bar** (team,
retrospective period pills — Last week / This month / This season — a match-type
select and a manual From/To range) and the **shared KPI strip**, matching the
attendance reports. The default window is the current season. On a phone the
filters collapse into the standard bottom-sheet; every control keeps a 48px
touch target.

### Standard reports — shared filter bar, squad fix, drill-downs

Four of the standard reports now carry the **same shared filter bar** the
attendance and minutes reports use: retrospective **period pills** (Last week /
This month / This season) plus a manual **From / To** range. The default window
is the **current season** (season start → today; a 90-day rolling window when no
season is configured). Picking a period pill drops any manual range; typing a
From / To overrides the pill. The reports affected are **Team · Squad
evaluation summary**, **Season summary**, **Season · Trial funnel** and
**Scout report card**. On a phone the filters collapse into the standard
bottom-sheet; every control keeps a 48px touch target. Each report's page
sub-line and its Explorer drill now name the same window, so the figure and the
drill agree.

The **Team · Minutes distribution** report had a squad-resolution bug: it counted
matches from the team's activities but built the player list from
`tt_players.team_id`, so a team whose players had no `team_id` set showed
"18 matches, 0 players". The squad is now derived the **same way the rest of
analytics resolves a team** — players with recorded attendance on the team's
match / game / tournament activities — so the player list and the match count
share one definition, and a player appears even with **0 recorded minutes**.
Minutes still come only from persisted `record_type='actual'` attendance rows
(they are never estimated), so a match with no recorded minutes contributes 0.

Standard-report **KPIs are now drill-downs** where a filtered list reconciles to
the count: the Team · Minutes distribution *Players* tile opens the team roster
and its *Matches* tile opens the activities list filtered to that team's matches;
the Season summary *Active players / Active teams / Matches* tiles open their
lists; the Trial funnel *Prospects logged* tile opens the prospects list. Every
drill carries a **← Back to …** hint and is hidden when the viewer lacks the
destination's capability (§7 hide-don't-tease).

## Player attendance — ranking + at-risk flags (v4.21.36)

The player attendance report defaults to **worst attendance first** (lowest present %), so the players who need attention surface at the top. It lists **every player** with recorded attendance in the window — no top-N cap — and every column stays sortable (click a header to re-sort).

Players who have **missed** a configurable number of activities in the window (absent / excused / injured) are **flagged**: an inline ⚠ badge with the missed count, a tinted row, and an **At-risk players** panel above the table listing them worst-first. The threshold (default **3**) is the *single source of truth* shared with the daily attendance-flag notification, so the report and the nudge email always agree.

The ⚠ badge (and each name in the **At-risk players** panel) is a **link** — tap it to trace the flag to the sessions behind it. It opens the same player-scoped activities list the *Activities* count uses (this player, the report's team, the report's window), so you can see the dated sessions the player attended and reconcile the missed count. A **← Back** link returns to the report.

### Tracing the activity count (drill-down)

Each player's **Activities** count is a link. Open it to see the actual sessions behind the number: the activities list opens filtered to that player, the report's team, and the report's date window, showing only activities the player has a recorded attendance row for. From there each activity opens its detail with the recorded attendance status, so a coach can reconcile the count with the source rows — the same tracing the minutes report offers. A **← Back** link returns to the report.

### Setting the at-risk threshold

The threshold lives in **Configuration → General → Attendance at-risk threshold** (an academy-admin setting). One number, between 1 and 50, drives every at-risk flag: the player attendance report, the attendance leaderboard, and the daily attendance-flag notification all read it. Lower it to catch slips earlier; raise it if your academy only wants to act on persistent absence.

## Attendance leaderboard (v4.27.0)

A dedicated league table reachable from the Reports launcher (*Attendance leaderboard*). It ranks players over the chosen window into two side-by-side tables: **Needs attention** (the lowest attendance %, where at-risk players keep their ⚠ badge) and **Most reliable** (the highest attendance %). By default it shows **all** players in the window; type a number in *How many* to narrow each table to that many rows. Optionally narrow to a single team. Coaches see only their own teams; academy-wide roles see the club.

It shares the same filter bar and chrome as the player attendance report: a **team** picker, retrospective **period** pills (last week / month / season and so on), an **activity type** filter, and a manual **date range** that overrides the active period, plus the leaderboard-only *How many* cap. Opening it with no filters defaults to the **current season** window. Above the tables a KPI strip summarises the ranked players — total players, average attendance across them, and how many are at-risk — computed from the same data, so it never triggers an extra query.

On a phone the two tables stack into one column with no horizontal scroll; from tablet width up they sit side-by-side. Every column is sortable on top of the default ranking.

Integrations can read the same data — with the same `tt_view_analytics` gate and team-scope narrowing — from:

- `GET /wp-json/talenttrack/v1/reports/attendance-leaderboard?from=…&to=…&n=…&team_id=…&activity_type_key=…` — `{ top, bottom, total }`.
- `GET /wp-json/talenttrack/v1/reports/attendance-at-risk?from=…&to=…&team_id=…&activity_type_key=…` — flagged players worst-first, each with a `declining` trend marker, plus the active `threshold`.
- `GET /wp-json/talenttrack/v1/reports/attendance?from=…&to=…&team_id=…&activity_type_key=…` — the per-player attendance rows for one window (powers the team report's inline drill-down): `{ players, threshold }`.

The optional `activity_type_key` on every attendance endpoint narrows to one activity type, matching the report UI's Type filter.

## Dimension explorer — row cap and filter validation

The dimension explorer (any KPI's *Explore* affordance) lets you filter a metric's underlying fact rows and drill into them. Two safeguards keep the drill-down honest:

- **5000-row cap, now visible.** The explorer reads at most **5000** fact rows for a drill-down. When a filtered set hits that ceiling the table shows a **"Capped at 5000 rows — use grouping to aggregate larger sets."** notice under the pager, so the visible page count is never mistaken for the whole dataset. Group by a dimension to aggregate larger sets instead of paging through raw rows.
- **Filters validated against the KPI's dimensions.** Only the dimensions a KPI actually offers for exploration are accepted as filters. A `filter_<key>` for a dimension the KPI doesn't declare is silently ignored — it never reaches the query or the CSV/PDF export, so the filters you see on screen always match the filters applied to the exported file.
