Frontend-first, modular youth football talent management system for a single club.

== Changelog ==

= 2.7.1 — Fix PeopleModule silent-skip =
* FIXED: PeopleModule did not implement ModuleInterface correctly — its register()/boot() signatures didn't accept the Container argument and the class didn't declare `implements ModuleInterface`. As a result, ModuleRegistry silently skipped it and the People menu never appeared. v2.7.1 ships a corrected PeopleModule.php. No schema changes; just reactivate (or simply visit wp-admin) to see the People menu.
