/**
 * Migration 0257 — the free-text `agenda` becomes a prep answer
 * (#3306, epic #3301).
 *
 * `tt_pdp_conversations.agenda` was the only thing a coach could fill in
 * before a talk: a bare textarea with no prompt, the same one for the
 * start-of-season conversation and the end-of-season one. Migration 0256
 * replaced it with configurable question sets; this moves what coaches
 * already wrote into them, so nothing is lost.
 *
 * WHERE IT GOES
 *
 * Every shipped question set ends with the free-text catch-all
 * `PdpPrepQuestionDefaults::ANYTHING_ELSE` — "Anything else to prepare?".
 * That is this migration's target, matched by `label_key` rather than by
 * wording, so an academy that reworded the question still gets its
 * coaches' text filed under it.
 *
 * A conversation whose template has no catch-all (an academy that archived
 * it before upgrading) keeps its `agenda` column untouched rather than
 * losing the text: the column stays for one release precisely so this case
 * is recoverable.
 *
 * THE COLUMN STAYS FOR ONE RELEASE
 *
 * Nothing writes `agenda` after this release, and no surface reads it, but
 * the column keeps its content. Same courtesy migration 0245 gave the match
 * analysis notes: if the move turns out wrong, the previous text is still
 * there to roll back to. A follow-up drops it once a release has passed.
 *
 * A NOTE ON WHO COULD SEE IT
 *
 * `agenda` was shown to the player on their own PDP view. Prep is coach and
 * head-of-academy only (epic decision 4), so text that moves here becomes
 * *less* visible, never more. That is deliberate — it is where a coach
 * writes candidly about a minor before sitting down with them — and it is
 * stated here because a migration that quietly changes who can read
 * something is the kind nobody finds later.
 *
 * Idempotent: the answer upsert is keyed on (conversation_id, question_id)
 * and skips a conversation that already has an answer against the target
 * question, so a re-run cannot overwrite what a coach has since written.
