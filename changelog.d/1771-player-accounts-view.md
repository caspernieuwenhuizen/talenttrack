# Player accounts view — link/unlink a WP account to a player (#1771)

Bump: minor

A new **Player accounts** view (`?tt_view=player-accounts`, academy/club
admin) lists every player with their account status — No account / Invited
/ Linked — and lets an admin directly **link** an existing WordPress user
to a player or **unlink** one, the primary account-mapping workflow.
Invitations stay the secondary self-service path (the Invite button reuses
the existing flow).

- Link is offered only for accounts not already bound to another player or
  a staff/parent record (no double-binding), and grants the player role.
- Unlink keeps the player record and removes the player role only when the
  account isn't linked elsewhere, so a coach-who-once-played keeps their
  access.
- Resource-oriented REST: `POST /players/{id}/account` (link) and
  `DELETE /players/{id}/account` (unlink), gated by `tt_manage_players`;
  the view and REST share one `PlayerAccountService` so a future
  non-WordPress front end gets the same answers.

Builds on the one-account-one-player DB guarantee from #1772, and supplies
that issue's app-layer "already linked" guard.
