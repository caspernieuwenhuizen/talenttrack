# TalentTrack v3.0.0 — Capability refactor + Migration UX + Frontend rebuild

**Status: SHIPPED.** v3.0.0 is the first TalentTrack release with a fully tile-based frontend, a genuinely useful Read-Only Observer role, and a one-click migration workflow.

## Headline changes

Three foundational rebuilds, landed together as a major version:

1. **Migration UX** — no more deactivate/reactivate dance. When you update TalentTrack, an admin notice with a "Run migrations now" button appears automatically. A "Run Migrations" link is always present on the Plugins page as a manual recovery path.

2. **Capability refactor** — every write-implying cap split into view + edit pairs. 8 view caps, 7 edit caps. The Read-Only Observer role now has meaningful access across the entire plugin — see everything, change nothing.

3. **Frontend fully rebuilt tile-based** — the v2.21 tile landing page now has 14 real destinations, one focused view per tile. No tab navigation anywhere. Me, Coaching, and Analytics groups all work end-to-end for their audiences.

## What changed

### Migration UX

Activating TalentTrack used to require deactivate + reactivate to trigger migrations. Easy to forget, and the symptoms of "skipped a migration" were confusing.

**Automatic version tracking.** `Activator::runMigrations()` stores `TT_VERSION` in the `tt_installed_version` option on every successful run. On every admin page load, TalentTrack compares the stored value to the running `TT_VERSION`.

**Admin notice on mismatch.** A yellow banner: *"TalentTrack schema needs updating. Plugin version 3.0.0 is loaded but installed schema is 2.22.0."* with a **Run migrations now** button. One click, migrations complete (within a second or two for typical data), banner disappears.

**Manual trigger on Plugins page.** A **Run Migrations** link sits next to the TalentTrack row alongside Deactivate and Edit. Always available, even when no migration is pending — useful if you suspect a prior run failed partially.

**Idempotent by design.** Every step (schema ensure, seed data, cap grants, self-healing) was already idempotent; we just surfaced it as a first-class admin action. Running twice when nothing changed is a no-op.

### Capability refactor

Pre-v3, four capabilities gated everything: `tt_manage_players`, `tt_evaluate_players`, `tt_manage_settings`, `tt_view_reports`. Each was binary — grant meant both view AND write. Impossible to have a meaningful read-only experience.

**New granular capabilities:**

| Area         | View                    | Edit                     |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Teams        | `tt_view_teams`         | `tt_edit_teams`          |
| Players      | `tt_view_players`       | `tt_edit_players`        |
| People       | `tt_view_people`        | `tt_edit_people`         |
| Evaluations  | `tt_view_evaluations`   | `tt_edit_evaluations`    |
| Sessions     | `tt_view_sessions`      | `tt_edit_sessions`       |
| Goals        | `tt_view_goals`         | `tt_edit_goals`          |
| Settings     | `tt_view_settings`      | `tt_edit_settings`       |
| Reports      | `tt_view_reports`       | *(no edit companion)*    |

**All 8 roles updated.** Every pre-built TalentTrack role has granular caps. Notably the Read-Only Observer now has all 8 view caps and zero edit caps.

**Legacy caps still work.** A `user_has_cap` filter resolves old cap names via the new granular caps. `current_user_can('tt_manage_players')` passes when the user has both `tt_view_players` AND `tt_edit_players`. Third-party code or Club Admin custom logic continues working.

**Every call site audited.** ~40 `current_user_can()` / `user_can()` calls rewritten to granular caps. Write handlers → `tt_edit_*`. List pages, menu entries, tile entries → `tt_view_*`. Page CAP constants → view cap. Role routing (`$is_admin`, `$is_coach` in dashboard) → edit cap preserving original semantics.

**UI write controls cap-gated.** Add New buttons and Edit/Delete row-action links in the 6 admin list pages (Teams, Players, People, Evaluations, Sessions, Goals) now render only when the user holds the appropriate `tt_edit_*` cap. Observers see `—` in the action column instead of buttons that would return Unauthorized when clicked.

### Observer role works end-to-end

- **Admin**: Full menu visible. Every list, every detail view, every report. Write buttons hidden. Bulk actions silently restricted to non-destructive views (the bulk-action dropdown gates per-entity `tt_edit_*`).
- **Frontend tile grid**: Analytics group (Rate cards, Player comparison) is their entry point. Coaching group tiles appear but link to "section only available for coaches" — clean gate, not broken link.

### Frontend fully rebuilt

The v2.21 tile landing page promised destinations that didn't exist — tapping "My goals" dropped you into a tab-heavy dashboard that ignored your tile choice. v3.0.0 fixes this with 14 new focused view classes:

**Me group** (player context, 6 tiles):
- `FrontendOverviewView` — FIFA card + custom fields + recent radar + print button
- `FrontendMyTeamView` — own card + team podium + teammate roster
- `FrontendMyEvaluationsView` — evaluation list with ratings and match context
- `FrontendMySessionsView` — attendance log, color-coded by status
- `FrontendMyGoalsView` — goal cards with status badges and due dates
- `FrontendMyProfileView` — **new** read-friendly personal details + link to WP account settings

**Coaching group** (coach + admin context, 6 tiles):
- `FrontendTeamsView` — every accessible team with podium + roster
- `FrontendPlayersView` — list (grouped by team) with detail sub-view via `?player_id=N`
- `FrontendEvaluationsView` — evaluation submission form
- `FrontendSessionsView` — session recording with attendance matrix
- `FrontendGoalsView` — goal creation + current-goals management
- `FrontendPodiumView` — aggregated top-3 across all accessible teams

**Analytics group** (observer / coach / admin, 2 tiles):
- `FrontendRateCardView` — reuses admin `PlayerRateCardView::render()` with a frontend base URL
- `FrontendComparisonView` — streamlined 4-slot player comparison (cards + facts + numbers + category averages; overlay charts remain admin-only)

**Supporting classes:**
- `FrontendViewBase` — abstract base with idempotent asset enqueueing and header + back button
- `CoachForms` — shared form rendering (evaluation, session, goals) — the AJAX contract with `FrontendAjax` is unchanged

### Router simplification

`DashboardShortcode::render()` dispatches cleanly:

```
if view empty          → tile landing
elseif view in me_slugs        → dispatchMeView      (requires player link)
elseif view in coaching_slugs  → dispatchCoachingView (requires coach/admin caps)
elseif view in analytics_slugs → dispatchAnalyticsView (requires tt_view_reports)
else                            → "Unknown section"
```

No role-branch tiebreaking, no fallback paths. Missing-capability cases produce explicit "This section is only available for …" notices.

### Slug disambiguation

Me-group slugs prefixed with `my-`: `my-evaluations` / `my-sessions` / `my-goals`. Coaching-group slugs of the same entity use the plain names (`evaluations`, `sessions`, `goals`). Dual-role users (coach who is also a player) now navigate unambiguously.

### Legacy views deleted

`src/Shared/Frontend/PlayerDashboardView.php` and `src/Shared/Frontend/CoachDashboardView.php` removed from the codebase. No parallel paths, no tab UI on the frontend.

## Files deleted in v3.0.0

- `src/Shared/Frontend/PlayerDashboardView.php`
- `src/Shared/Frontend/CoachDashboardView.php`

## Files changed in v3.0.0

Extensive — essentially every admin page (CAP constants + UI gating), every write handler (cap check rewrites), all routing code (DashboardShortcode, FrontendTileGrid), the RolesService (complete rewrite with granular caps), and 3 wiki topics (access-control, player-dashboard, coach-dashboard) refreshed.

## Upgrade

1. Deploy the v3.0.0 code (extract ZIP, replace `talenttrack/` folder contents)
2. Navigate to any admin page. If a "TalentTrack schema needs updating" notice appears (it should, on first load after upgrade), click **Run migrations now**.
3. That's it. Role caps + schema state will be current.

For future minor-version updates (3.0.1, 3.1.0, etc.) the same flow works — notice appears, one click, done.

## Verify

**Migration UX**
1. After install: the banner should clear automatically once migrations have run.
2. Plugins page: next to the TalentTrack row, a "Run Migrations" link.
3. Simulate outdated state: edit `wp_options.tt_installed_version` via phpMyAdmin to an older version, reload admin. Banner reappears. Click, success.

**Capability refactor + Observer role**
1. Create a user with the Read-Only Observer role.
2. Log in as them. Visit wp-admin. Full TalentTrack menu visible.
3. Open Teams, Players, Evaluations, etc. — lists load, detail views open.
4. Action column in every list shows `—` (no Edit/Delete links). Add New button absent.
5. Visit the frontend dashboard. Analytics group tiles visible (Rate cards, Player comparison). Tap either — picker + full content.
6. Try to access admin edit URL directly (e.g., `admin.php?page=tt-players&action=edit&id=1`). Page loads read-only. Click Save — Unauthorized error at the controller.

**Frontend Me-group (Player role)**
1. Create a user linked to a player record. Log in.
2. Frontend dashboard shows the Me tile group.
3. Tap each tile — overview, my team, my evaluations, my sessions, my goals, my profile. Each renders a focused sub-page with back button. No tab bars.

**Frontend Coaching-group (Coach role)**
1. Log in as a Coach.
2. Coaching tile group visible.
3. Tap Teams — see accessible teams with podiums + rosters.
4. Tap Players — see list; tap a card — see detail view with "← Back to players" link.
5. Tap Evaluations — submission form. Submit — AJAX success message.
6. Same for Sessions and Goals. AJAX contract unchanged from v2.x.

**Frontend Analytics (any role with `tt_view_reports`)**
1. Tap Rate cards tile. Player picker. Pick a player. Rate card renders (FIFA card, headline numbers, radar, trend).
2. Tap Player comparison tile. 4 slot pickers. Pick players, filters. Compare button → cards row + basic facts + headline numbers + main category averages.

## Design notes

- **Why this is a major version.** Frontend rebuild alone breaks bookmarks to v2.21 tiles that never worked. Cap refactor changes cap names (though alias preserves behaviour). Migration UX changes the upgrade workflow. Any of the three warranted a minor; together they're a major.
- **Why aliases instead of a hard break on legacy caps.** Ecosystem courtesy. Custom admin code in clubs, shortcodes in child themes, etc. might check legacy cap names. The alias filter is tiny (~10 lines of map_meta_cap logic), runs on every cap resolve, and adds no practical overhead. It stays through v3.x. Considering removal in v4+.
- **Why `CoachForms` instead of keeping form rendering in `CoachDashboardView`.** Legacy class was deleted. New views needed the form renderers. Extract + delete the source.
- **Why the frontend comparison view skips overlay charts.** Chart.js multi-dataset setup is ~200 lines of bespoke JS. Primary use case for comparison-on-frontend is quick review, not deep analysis. Deep analysis → admin page. Cleaner separation.
- **Why the observer tile grid doesn't hide Coaching tiles.** The tile grid already gates tiles by cap at render time (they only appear for users with the right caps). Observer has no `tt_edit_*` so Coaching tiles don't render for them. The user messaging for wrong-role access applies when a URL is directly entered.
- **Why no breaking change to AJAX actions.** `FrontendAjax` handler names (`tt_fe_save_evaluation`, etc.) are preserved. The new forms post to the same endpoints. Anyone with a stored form-submit URL or a browser extension still works.
