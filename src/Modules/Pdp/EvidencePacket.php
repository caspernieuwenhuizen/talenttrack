/**
 * EvidencePacket — everything the academy already knows about a player,
 * assembled once for the moment a coach or a head of academy has to say
 * where that player is and where they are going.
 *
 * It is the single source for the three surfaces that show evidence: the
 * Evidence tab on a PDP conversation, the printed file, and the verdict
 * screen. They used to assemble their own, filter differently, and put
 * three sets of numbers in front of three readers who assumed they were
 * looking at the same thing.
 *
 * Two entry points, one builder, two windows:
 *
 *   EvidencePacket::forFile( $file_id )                 // the whole season
 *   EvidencePacket::forConversation( $conversation_id ) // since the last talk
 *
 * Read-only aggregation; nothing is mutated by building a packet, and the
 * shape is JSON-serialisable so a non-WordPress front end can consume it
 * over `GET /pdp-files/{id}/evidence-packet` unchanged.
 *
 * Every query is club-scoped and excludes archived and trashed rows. That
 * is not decoration: it is the reason the three surfaces can now agree.
