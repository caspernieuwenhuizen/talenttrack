/**
 * SessionPlanContext — the working object passed through every RulePass.
 *
 * Mutable across the pipeline (each pass returns the same instance with
 * its own mutations applied), but the pipeline is single-threaded and
 * the engine never exposes a context to outside callers — only the
 * final `Session` payload is returned.
 *
 * Fields fall into three buckets:
 *
 *   1. Input — set by the VctTrainingComposer before the pipeline runs:
 *      team_id, season_id, age_group, session_date, tactical_theme,
 *      roster_player_ids, requested_duration_minutes (optional).
 *
 *   2. Resolved constraints — set by passes 1–5: intensity ceiling,
 *      md_context, session_minutes_max, slots[], progression multiplier.
 *
 *   3. Result — set by passes 6+: blocks[], total_load, warnings[].
