/**
 * VctActivityStamper — writes the cycle week onto a training activity
 * (#3362, epic #3354).
 *
 * The stamp is a **snapshot**, and that is deliberate. A training records
 * the cycle week it was planned as; adding a fixture in October shifts
 * every week after it, and past trainings keep what they said. That is
 * what makes a player's training history readable months later, rather
 * than a list that quietly rewrites itself whenever a cycle is
 * reconfigured.
 *
 * Future trainings are a different matter — they have not happened, so
 * they are re-stamped when the thing they were derived from moves.
 *
 * ## One service, one hook
 *
 * Activities are written from at least four places (the wizard, the
 * manage form, the Spond import, VCT publish). Rather than four copies
 * of resolve-and-write, everything hangs off `tt_activity_saved`, the
 * action `ActivitiesRepository` already fires on every create and update.
 *
 * The stamp itself is written with a direct `$wpdb->update()` rather than
 * back through the repository: it is a derived column, not an edit, and
 * routing it through `update()` would re-fire `tt_activity_saved` and
 * recurse.
