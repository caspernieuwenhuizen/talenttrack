/**
 * ActivityTypeKey — typed constants for the five values stored in
 * `tt_activities.activity_type_key`. Backs the `activity_type` lookup
 * (operator-editable via the lookups admin) but the seeded values below
 * are the canonical set used by every consumer (analytics dimensions,
 * workflow templates that filter `activity_type_key = 'game'`,
 * match-prep gating, etc.).
 *
 * Use the constants in PHP comparisons:
 *
 *     if ( $activity->activity_type_key === ActivityTypeKey::GAME ) { ... }
 *
 * In SQL, use `MATCH_LIKE_SQL` rather than writing the values out again.
 * Four separate queries had drifted onto a `'match'` literal that this
 * vocabulary has never contained, and so matched nothing.
 *
 * REST endpoints accept BOTH the literal AND the constant for one release
 * per #988's backward-compat allowlist; see docs/rest-api.md for the
 * deprecation timeline.
