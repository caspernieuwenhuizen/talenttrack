/**
 * ActivitiesRestController — /wp-json/talenttrack/v1/activities
 *
 * #0019 Sprint 1 — replaces the legacy `tt_fe_save_session` admin-ajax
 * path. Attendance is a nested sub-resource handled inline on create
 * and update because the UI posts the full attendance matrix with the
 * activity form. Fail-loud: every $wpdb write return value is checked
 * and failures land in the Logger.
 *
 * #0037 — three REST routes that #0035 missed (the rename gate didn't
 * cover REST URL segments). Routes were registered as /sessions* and
 * the JS client at guest-add.js POSTs to /activities/{id}/guests, so
 * adding a guest 404'd and the modal got stuck in the "kritieke fout"
 * state. Routes are now /activities*.

     * FrontendActivitiesManageView::renderForm — the JS helper hides
     * off-team rows visually, but the hidden form fields still submit).

     * wrote it as is_guest = 0, producing rows where the player's
     * team_id != the activity's team_id without explicit guest
     * intention.
     *
     * Integrity rule now enforced here at the data-layer chokepoint:
     * non-guest attendance MUST be on the activity's roster. Any
     * submitted player_id whose current team_id != activity.team_id
     * is silently dropped (with a warning log so operators can see when
     * the UI is sending off-roster ids). The explicit guest path
     * (POST /sessions/{id}/guests → is_guest = 1) remains the only way
     * to record off-roster attendance.
