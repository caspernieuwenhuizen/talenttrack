/**
 * #3291 — every filter group carries a modifier for its TYPE, not only for
 * its key.
 *
 * #2203 right-aligned the trailing utility controls with a rule written
 * against `.tt-filterbar__group--status`. That is a KEY modifier, and no
 * surface in the app uses `status` as a group key: the list tables and the
 * activities view pass `archived`, the alerts inbox passes `state`, and
 * `FrontendListTable::statusGroup()` passes the caller's own filter key. The
 * rule therefore matched nothing, on every surface, since it was written —
 * the `⋯` menu sat mid-row against its neighbour with empty space to its
 * right, reading as one more filter rather than a utility.
 *
 * The lesson the assertions below encode: a rule about what a group IS has
 * to key on the type, because the key belongs to the caller and will not
 * agree with it.
